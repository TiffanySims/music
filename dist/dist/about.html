            Hello, my name is Tiffany Sims and I reside in the Chicago area. I
            am a graduate from Chicago State Universiy with a B.s in Computer
            Science. I became interested in coding about 7 years ago. I took an
            intro to programming course and fell in love. I made a commitment to
            develop as a technical professional. The first language I learned
            was c++ and during my senior year I tutored c++. In 2017, while
            researching possible career paths. I came across a video about web
            development. I've been learning ever since. I enjoy the fact that I
            can be creative as well as a programmer. The most valuable asset
            that I can provide to your company is the ability to be molded to
            your stack.
